# BI Adoption & Governance Intelligence Engine

A mock-driven analytics engine that evaluates BI adoption and governance health without requiring live BI server access.

## Why This Matters
Organizations invest heavily in BI tools but lack visibility into:
- Actual adoption
- Unused dashboards
- Governance risks

This project simulates BI usage data and generates executive-ready insights.

## Key Features
- Mock REST API ingestion
- Adoption & governance scoring
- Modular analytics architecture
- CSV reporting for leadership

## Status
✅ End-to-end MVP complete  
🚀 Designed for real BI platform integration
