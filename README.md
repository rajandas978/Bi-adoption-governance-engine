# BI Adoption & Governance Intelligence Engine

## Executive Summary
Organizations invest heavily in BI platforms but often lack visibility into actual adoption, governance risks, and ROI leakage.  
This project addresses that gap by providing a **BI adoption and governance analytics engine** that delivers executive-ready insights without requiring live BI server access.

The solution is designed using a **mock-driven architecture**, making it production-ready while remaining secure and testable.

---

## Business Problem
Leadership teams struggle to answer:
- Who is actually using BI platforms?
- Which dashboards are unused and creating cost waste?
- Where are governance and adoption risks?
- How can BI ROI be improved?

---

## Solution Overview
This project simulates BI usage data (similar to Tableau REST API outputs) and applies analytics to generate:
- Adoption score
- Governance health score
- Actionable optimization insights

The same architecture can be connected to live BI platforms when access is available.

---

## Key Capabilities
- Mock REST API ingestion (no server dependency)
- Active vs inactive user analysis
- Unused dashboard detection
- Adoption & governance scoring
- Executive-ready CSV reporting
- Modular, production-grade architecture

---

## Architecture
- **Collectors**: Ingest usage data
- **Analytics Engine**: Apply adoption & governance logic
- **Output Layer**: Generate leadership reports

---

## Example Insights Generated
- 40% of users inactive in last 30 days
- 33% dashboards unused in 90 days
- Adoption Score: 72 / 100
- Governance Health Score: 66 / 100
